# 📝 Tasks Manager API

This is my **first Spring Boot application**, built as a challenge for a company. It is a simple RESTful API for managing tasks.

## 🚀 About the Project

The application provides a clean and well-structured **REST API** that allows users to:

- Create new tasks
- View all tasks
- Update existing tasks
- Delete tasks

It follows good development practices such as **DTO usage**, **service-repository-controller layering**, and **database migrations** using Flyway.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** & **Spring Boot**
- **PostgreSQL** for database
- **Flyway** for database migration/version control
- **Spring Data JPA** for ORM
- **DTOs** to separate data layers
- **DBEaver** as a GUI tool to manage the database

## 📚 What I Learned

As this was my first Spring Boot project, I learned a lot, including:

- The **structure of a Spring Boot app**
- How to define and use **entities**, **DTOs**, and **repositories**
- How to write clean and reusable code with **services** and **controllers**
- Using **Flyway** to manage database migrations
- Setting up and interacting with a **PostgreSQL** database
- Using **DBEaver** to visualize and inspect my database

This project helped me go from zero to building a complete backend with Spring Boot.
